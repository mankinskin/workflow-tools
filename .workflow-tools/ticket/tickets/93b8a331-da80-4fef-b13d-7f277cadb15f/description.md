# Completed design

Created `.spec/specs/9e823b76-cd60-4689-b772-649ebb3a34a1/` defining the repository-native subprocess runner, structured reporter/result adapter, provenance, retry/outcome, blocked-capability, artifact, wasm-pack, and benchmark mappings.

## Evidence

- `spec health 9e823b76-cd60-4689-b772-649ebb3a34a1`: passed with zero findings.
- `spec refs validate 9e823b76-cd60-4689-b772-649ebb3a34a1`: passed.
- Local test-api ticket health for the follow-up dependency: passed with zero findings.

## Follow-up

`8f364a0c-35ab-4faa-b49a-20d98b6f2905` owns the adapter implementation and depends on this design. The spec links the umbrella `956485ad`; cross-store edge insertion through the aggregated index is currently blocked because the new memory-api ticket has not yet appeared in `default` discovery.
