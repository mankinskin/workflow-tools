# Session Objective
Resolve the current static_complexity batch for viewer-api and reduce 6 findings from the baseline.

# Scope Guardrails
- Stay inside viewer-api unless a blocker requires a dependency fix outside scope.
- Do not start the next batch until this ticket meets done criteria.

# Implementation Steps
1. Capture exact finding rows for this batch from the baseline audit artifact.
2. Group findings into 2 to 5 micro-chunks and handle one chunk at a time.
3. After each chunk, run the narrowest compile/test check relevant to touched files.
4. Re-run audit summary and record count delta.
5. If blockers remain, create follow-up tickets and link them before handoff.

# Validation Commands
- Full category summary: cargo run -p audit-cli --bin audit -- --json summary --by category .
- Full baseline refresh when needed: cargo run -p audit-cli --bin audit -- --json run .
- Ticket health sanity: ./target/debug/ticket.exe health --workspace . --all --toon

# Acceptance Criteria
- Findings in this batch are resolved or have explicit blocker tickets linked.
- No increase in other categories caused by this batch.
- Batch notes include before and after counts and next unresolved action.

# Handoff Notes
Record exact commands run, resulting counts, and files changed so the next session can continue without rediscovery.
